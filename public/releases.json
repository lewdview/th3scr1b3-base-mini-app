But my dreams, they are coming back Thanks for no one trying Makes me wanna be here We were getting our dreams out I got more than you Inside of me, you'll hear I'm all about it here all the time And I got these dreams I know that I find I don't know if they're right When you know that you're right there Dreaming with me These are dreams that you don't know I said all day, all day, all day Till it gets, till it gets Oh, these dreams keep me up at night These wants make me wanna fight off An intellectual part of me I said these dreams keep me up at night These hearts always take me the wrong way Hard way, every which way But my home is some simple instance of my mind And I don't wanna think about all the times That I broke your heart And took your dreams away, baby But I know these dreams are taking with me And another chance it will be What we want to see, oh baby These dreams, they be coming up right Yeah, they be making me fight Yeah, they be making me fuck my life up all the way But I know that you can dream with me A little brighter and be more than we see Come on now, be more than you ever thought could be With these dreams in your night Yeah, these dreams, they fight you But do they haunt you? Or do they just make you start at the beginning again? Is it that bad to get exploited as me? These faces of people appear that I've never seen And I know that these dreams, they come at night I don't care, I'm not scared anymore Of what you'll say to my only thoughts Just know that I am coming in time Say another look To write another book Who you wanna see on the hook? Baby, with my dreams at night You know I rock this shit all right No fighting, fussing, fuck the fighting, yeah You know",
